## Site structure

- `_config.yml` is the Jekyll configuration.
- `index.md` is the contents of the site’s homepage.
- `_posts` are listed on the homepage from newest to oldest.

## Publishing notes

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/torchbox/tate-cms/edit/gh-pages/index.md) to maintain and preview the content of the site in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) files.

When creating a new post,

- The post’s filename needs to start with a date in the YYYY-MM-DD format: https://github.com/torchbox/tate-cms/blob/main/_posts/2021-04-21-ep1-inception-and-discovery.md
- The post title should be wrapped in quotes, for example: `title: "This week’s sprint"`

The [live site](https://torchbox.github.io/tate-cms/) is automatically updated whenever making changes in GitHub.
